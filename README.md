# diffusion-model
project involves building generative models such as Stable Diffusion based on the research paper
`Denoising diffusion probabilistic models` research paper using PyTorch.

paper available in the repo as `pdf`


## Downloading the `ckpt` file :

1.) Download `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt` from https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main
    and save it in the `data` folder
